                    <p class="lead">My mom’s family is a combination of the Zak and Melamed families. Her father was Gregory Zak, formerly known as Hirsh before the communist revolution. His parents were Gabriel Zak and Khasya-Itke Kevilevich. Now, let me share the Zak family story from Lev Kokin (he went to the war at the age of 18 and got wounded in the leg near Kenigsberg. He has a diverse repertoire of written works, including scripts for multiple films and a poignant story centered around his mother—an inspiring revolutionary figure who was put in prison under Stalin’s depression in 1937. Among his notable achievements is the screenplay for the film “Yasha Toporkov’s Easy Life,” skillfully directed by E. Karelov and brilliantly portrayed by the talented E. Evstigneev.  ), who was my mother’s cousin:
                    </p>
                    <img class="family_image" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxsuizt1v/image/upload/v1690573087/mom_side/lev_kokin_rcu1zl.jpg" width="400px" >
                    <p class="lead">On May 2nd, 1998, I visited the former Jewish cemetery on Collectornaya Street in Minsk, where our grandmother Khasya rests. However, it was not exactly at the grave, as the cemetery had been demolished in the 60s by bulldozers and covered with black soil. I recall seeing the dump trucks transporting the debris. Khasya-Itke, whose premarital surname was Kivelevich, had an impressive education, being fluent in Russian, Polish, German, Yiddish, and Hebrew. She possessed a range of skills, including midwifery and nursing, which made her highly respected among the Belarusian community.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="lead">Khasya got married relatively late for those times, at 27 years old, to our grandfather Gabriel, who was younger than her. Our great-grandfather remains somewhat of a mystery, as his name was unknown, but he was a cantonist, one of the Jewish boys conscripted into the Russian Tzar’s army. He survived and received land, nobility, and awards for his service. Aunt Rosa, who showed interest in our family history, shared stories of his strong character and physical prowess.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="lead">After retiring from the army, our great-grandfather supported Gabriel’s marriage with a substantial sum of money. With this, they leased land from a Polish countess, bought cows, and produced butter to make a living. Life was prosperous until 1908, when a law prohibiting Jews from renting land caused their downfall. This law, along with other discriminatory measures, drove thousands of Jews into poverty and confined them to ghettos, giving rise to Russian anti-Semitism.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="lead">The impact of this law was profound, forcing Jews into certain professions, which perpetuated stereotypes and prejudice within the broader society. It was a tragic and brutal turn of events that significantly affected the lives of many Jewish families.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="lead">Due to the oppressive circumstances, the Zak family fell into poverty. Grandmother Khasya worked as a floor washer in affluent houses in Volozhin, earning two kopecks, which was equivalent to one white bun at the time. In an attempt to escape poverty, grandfather Gabriel sought a better life in the United States with the help of Zionists. However, his dreams were shattered as he fell ill with Parkinson’s disease and struggled to find employment. He returned to Minsk in 1920, after a seven-year absence, penniless and in a single suit, as evidenced by a photograph with my mother.

                    <p class="lead">Surprisingly, the outbreak of the 1914 war saved the Zak from extinction, as they were granted refugee status, which provided them with free meals and housing. They were relocated to Minsk in 1915, settling in a house near the former Red Barracks, now at the corner of Kuibyshev and Varvashenka streets.

                    <p class="lead">Despite the challenging conditions with no heating, indoor latrine, and scarce food supplies like bread, meat, butter, and sugar, the family managed to survive and even pursue higher education. The available information is limited, but the Zak family undoubtedly has an ancient history, with their surname possibly having German origins. “Sak” meaning a bag suggests that their ancestors might have lived in Germany and were either very wealthy (having a bag of money) or extremely poor. The exact truth behind their origins remains uncertain.

                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="lead">This letter is not addressed to you and Vladimir but to your dear sons, Sasha and Dima. I’ve been wanting to write it for quite some time, and now I’ve finally decided to do so. Let’s discuss the family inheritance of the Zak family. As the eldest in the family and with not much time left, I feel it is my duty to pass on this knowledge, hence why I’m reaching out to you both.</p>
                     <br>
                     <p class="lead">Dear boys, God willing, you are still young, full of hope, and there’s so much for you to learn, if not almost everything, about your relatives on both your father’s and mother’s side, especially concerning the Zak family. It’s essential to know and cherish your family history, and you should pass this knowledge on to your descendants.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="lead">I’m delighted to share with you that our ancestors were honest and upright people who never harmed anyone. Their names, in order of age, were Sonia, Hirsch, Shail, Rivka, Sholem, and Rosa. None of them were involved in any wrongdoings, never relied on others for support, and worked hard to lead respectable lives. Now, I’ll focus on the men for this moment, as writing about women can be more intricate, and I’ll save that for another time.

                    <p class="lead">The unnamed Zak was born in Volozin, Belarus. Though his name has been lost to time, my dear and late aunt Rosa, in her blessed memory, told me that he was among the Cantonists. These were impoverished children, aged 10-12, who were forcibly taken from their mothers to serve in the Russian army between 1826-1830. The heartless Czar Nicholas I aimed to fill his army ranks, subjecting these children to unimaginable hardships, abuse, and scarce provisions. It’s been recorded that thousands of Cantonists perished, with only one in ten surviving. Fortunately, our great grandfather managed to endure and showed great bravery in battles against Poles and Hungarians. He earned several decorations and eventually received the highest rank of Feldfabel, granting him Russian land that cannot be inherited. This land was bestowed upon him akin to a Polish nobleman. Aunt Rosa described him as a stern figure, a strict authoritarian, always dedicated to his work. While he instilled fear in the family, he also loved and cared deeply for the children. His voice was hoarse, and he demanded obedience both in family matters and labor from a very young age. Unfortunately, we don’t know where he lived or where he passed away.

                        <p class="lead">Records about Gabriel Zak in USA that recieved from local reasher:
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="lead">I located two records that may be interesting for you. The first is a 1920 census record for a Gabriell Zak, who was a 'roomer' (he rented a room) on Moon Street in Akron, in Summit County. This may or may not be your great-grandfather, but I think it is. His age is given as 40 and year of immigration is given as 1913; these details are similar enough that I think it must be the same person, but I can't be sure. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="lead">I also found a record of naturalization for Gabriell Zak living at 4810 Scovill Avenue in Cleveland, the address on your post card. (We were very near this area on the bus, but this street no longer exists in that part of the neighborhood.) Gabriell Zak's birthdate is given as October 15, 1877. He arrived in the US on July 1, 1912 in Baltimore, Maryland. He applied for naturalization in Cleveland, but his naturalization was denied on June 26, 1925. The record does not say why naturalization was denied, but it's possible this may have been the reason he eventually returned to Minsk. Because the address is the same on the post card, I assume this is your relative. But, if the census record is also true, this means that he arrived in Cleveland and then moved to Akron but then moved back to the same address in Cleveland, from where he applied for naturalization. Of course, he may simply have used the address of friends at 4810 Scovill to apply for naturalization.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="lead">What evidence do you have that he returned to Belarus in 1919? The records here indicate that he stayed in Cleveland, since he was denied naturalization in 1925. Also, 1919 would not have been a very good year to return to Belarus. It's much more likely that he returned after 1925, when the border between Poland and the Soviet Union was much clearer and the war had really ended.

                        I was born in 1905 in the town of Volotsin. Until 1913, my father, Gabriel, worked as a farmer on rented land. In that year, he decided to immigrate to USA and found employment in various factories. However, due to his medical condition, he had to return to Minsk  in 1922 and rely on the care of his children. Tragically, he passed away in the Minsk ghetto in 1942.<br><br>
                        
                        My mother was a devoted housewife and unfortunately, she passed away in 1941. My own educational journey involved schooling until 1916, after which I started working as an employee. From 1924 to 1927, I pursued further studies at the Vitebsk Polytechnic. Subsequently, I was assigned to work at the Kirov machine factory in Gomel until the outbreak of the war. Then, I was sent to Sverdlovsk and became a senior technologist at the Kalinin factory from 1941 to 1948.<br><br>
                        
                        Gregory was part of the team that developed Katuasha, that was a game changer weapon during Second world was.<br><br>
                        
                        In 1948, I began working at the Chakalov tool factory. As for my relatives, I must convey the heartbreaking news that my brother lost his life in the war in 1942. My surviving brother, Alexander, works as an electrical engineer at Belpromproject in Minsk. My sisters, Riva and Rosa, are both housewives. Riva’s husband is an economist, and they reside in Cheboksary. Rosa’s husband holds the position of director in the party department of the Red Star newspaper in Moscow.<br><br>
                        
                        Regrettably, we have no remaining relatives in the world.<br><br>

                        Mom told me that grandfather Gregory was Zionist and was hearing Israeli radio - Kol Israel, specially during Six day war. <br>

                    <p class="lead">Memories of my grandmother Elena Zak (Melamed) 24.4.1966: <br><br>

                        I was born on May 7, 1912, into the family of an official in the city of Gomel. My educational journey began in 1919 when I enrolled in school, and I successfully graduated in 1928. Following that, I started my career at a bread factory in Gomel and worked there until 1931.<br><br>
                        
                        In 1931, I was accepted into the prestigious Plytechnic University of Minsk, where I pursued my studies until 1936. However, due to my family situation and health issues, I had to leave the university before completing my degree. From 1936 to 1939, I worked at the Kirov factory in Gomel as a mechanical technician in the technical department.<br><br>
                        
                        In 1939, another change in my family situation prompted me to leave my job. Subsequently, in 1941, we were relocated to the city of Sverdlovsk, where we resided until 1948. At that time, the local Ministry of Industry invited my husband to work in Minsk, and our entire family moved there.<br><br>
                        
                        In 1962, I found employment at the Opera Theater as a ticket seller (cashier). Later that year, I transitioned to work at the central theater box office, where I have remained employed to this day. The theater has become a significant part of my life, and I cherish the memories I’ve made throughout my career.<br><br>

                    <p class="lead">Dear mother,<br><br>

                        You were born in Yekaterinburg, on the western outskirts of Siberia, in 1942. Your father, a talented engineer, played a key role in the relocation of Russian military production capabilities during World War II to the Ural Mountains, and you often spoke of him with admiration and great respect. Your mother also contributed to the war effort by hosting Red Army soldiers on their way to the front at your home. She gave them her bed and what little food you had in the house, while she slept on the floor. You told us about your struggles to be accepted to university to study engineering as a Jew, in the face of a numerical limitation that was applied to Jews. And yet, you succeeded. Later on, you taught yourself programming and wrote code in COBOL on punch card machines. I remember that once you took me to your work to run a game of tic-tac-toe on the hulking computer.. It took at least half an hour of preparation and as far as I remember I wasn’t very impressed by the experience 😊 <br><br>
                        
                        Later, in the 90’s after our family trip in Moscow, you made the decision with Dad to immigrate to Israel. You were already in your forties and were not afraid to make such a dramatic change at a not-so-young age. The personal implication of this move was a decline in economic and social status, but you were willing to pay the price because you were convinced it was the right thing for me and Alex. You made a personal sacrifice for those you loved most and experienced the difficult implications without complaining or asking for anything in return.<br><br>
                        
                        Thank you for the good years, the potent lessons, the tremendous patience, the great stubbornness, and the infinite love. The impermanence of life sometimes hits you out of nowhere, whether you're trying to be mindful of its existence at every moment or not. In another generation or two, it will be hard to remember the experiences we had, the challenges we overcame, and the failures we could not overcome. But it doesn't matter, because you mattered! Not only to me but to countless people who, when we informed them of your passing away, were quick to tell us how they saw you. A righteous woman, compassionate, always ready to help, and full of love. You were significant in your giving, in your broad human heart, in life's lessons, in perseverance, in a strong spirit, and in the immense devotion to your children and grandchildren. Your life, although sometimes not easy, was filled with openness, curiosity, and the aspiration to give us... your children and grandchildren the best possible.<br><br>
                        
                        There are many good moments of us that I will always remember… some of them very personal and some less so. One of the best moments happened just last Monday when I came to visit you after a trip abroad. You smiled at me the moment you saw me, it was a radiant smile, full of happiness and filled with the purest love you can imagine. Despite the pain, discomfort, and physical deterioration, you said a few words that a mother says to her son, which mean the world to me. That's how I'll remember you - radiantly happy and loving.<br><br>
                        
                        May you no longer know suffering and pain, may you know only peace, tranquillity, and harmony in the place you're heading now. Enjoy the best the universe has to offer. My love will always accompany you.<br><br>

                            Sonia Zak married Kokin Grigori, and they had two children: Galia and Lev. Galia is a mother to a daughter named Masha, while Lev has two children of his own: Sasha and Lena Kokin.<br><br>
                            
                            Rosa, unfortunately, did not have any children.<br><br>

                            Sasha Zak faced heartbreaking tragedy when the Nazis took the lives of his wife Luba and their two children. After the war, he married to Rosa. They have a daughter named Natasha, who now has a son called Maksim<br><br>

                                Our group became part of the team working on the BESM-1 computer, which included notable figures like Andrey Andreevich Sokolov, Valery Nazarovich Laut, Mark Valeriyanovich Tyapkin, and Leonid Aleksandrovich Zak. Meeting Leonid Zak in the computer room was a delightful surprise for me, considering we both graduated from Moscow’s School No. 370 in Sokolniki in 1950. I was in grade 10B, while Lenya was in grade 10A, where he earned a gold medal and later joined MPEI, and I went to the Naval Engineering School in Leningrad.<br><br>
                               
                               Leonid Alexandrovich Zak proved to be an incredibly talented engineer, always modest, hardworking, and compassionate. He was ever-ready to assist his colleagues, and his dedication led him to receive the State Prize of the USSR twice, rightfully earning his place among the “luminaries.” Throughout his career, he devoted himself to ITM and VT.<br><br>
                               
                               A school friend, Sergey Sergeevich Karinsky, a doctor of technical sciences and a leading specialist in fiber-optic information transmission systems at RTI im. Mints, once made a remark about our school days, saying: “In our school, two people were developing computers: Lenya Zak, a genius, and Dod Feinberg, a lazy person.”<br><br>
                               </p>
                               <p class="lead">Here is another paragraph where he is mentioned:<br><br>

                                The last time I had the chance to see Lenya Zak was in 2008. Leonid Aleksandrovich worked tirelessly in a small room on the top floor of the main building of ITM and VT. It was a windowless space, previously used as a utility room, but he had transformed it into his workspace. There, he took care of debugging the TEZs himself to fulfill various orders. Work was an integral part of Leonid’s life; he couldn’t imagine a life without it. May he rest in blessed memory.

                            <p class="lead">Originating from the Evdasin family in Gomel, Tzila’s father was Simcha, the son of Pesach, and her mother’s name was Rivka (with her father’s name being Zalman). Simcha had a successful tea factory, and during the time of the communist revolution, he possibly invested his money in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

                            <p class="lead">Tzila had three siblings: Evgeniya, Pesach, and Berta (also known as Bubenia). Bubenia had a son named Anatoly (Tolik). Tragically, Pesach lost his life during the Second World War in a Soviet prison camp after someone betrayed him to the Nazis, revealing that he was Jewish.

                         <p class="lead>">My father, Vladimir Glushenkov, was born in 1946 in Minsk to parents Maya and Andrey Glushenkov. Two years later, his twin siblings, Olga and Alexander (Sashka), were born. Due to his mother’s young age and inability to care for him, she entrusted him to her mother, Tzila, who lovingly raised him alongside his cousin Toma.<br><br>

                            Growing up with his grandmother, my father often spoke fondly of her and the valuable life lessons she instilled in him. At the age of 14, he left school and began working as an optical expert at Vovilov military factory, where he built lenses for Katuasha missiles.<br><br>
                            
                            In 1975, he married a Russian woman and had a daughter named Yulia. However, the marriage ended in divorce a year later. In 1977, he met my mother, Isanna, and they got married in November of the same year. Together, they had two children, me in 1978 and my brother Danny (Dimitriy) in 1981.<br><br>
                            
                    
                            In the summer of 1989, during a family trip to Moscow, my father applied for an Israeli visa and received it in January 1990. Due to the rising antisemitism in the USSR, my parents decided to emigrate to Israel with us on July 17, 1990.<br><br>
                            
                            Shortly after arriving in Israel, the Gulf War began, but my father remained fearless, not even bothering to wear a gas protection mask during sirens.<br><br>
                            
                            
                            In 1996, he was diagnosed with CPOD illness, which was attributed to excessive smoking. He underwent experimental surgery, where half of his lungs were removed on each side. Although he stopped working after the surgery, he remained functional and even traveled abroad several times.<br><br>
                            
                            However, in January 2018, his lungs collapsed, and he spent almost a month in the ER in a sedated condition. Subsequently, he underwent a tracheotomy and was transferred to a special hospital for weaning. Despite the efforts, he couldn’t recover and passed away in November 2018.<br><br>

                        <p class="lead">Her life journey began in January 1942, during the tumultuous times of World War II. Prior to her birth, the Nazis had a strong presence in the USSR, and our late grandmother even contemplated aborting her due to concerns about her survival. However, she defied the odds and survived, with her name Isanna chosen as a tribute to her father Israel.<br><br>

                            Throughout her life, she excelled in various endeavors. She was an exceptional student, demonstrating remarkable penmanship and achieving top-notch grades, all while maintaining a warm and compassionate heart. Despite the restrictive policies allowing only 5% of Jews in higher education, her outstanding academic performance enabled her to pursue an engineering major at the university.<br><br>
                            
                            After graduating, she embarked on a career as a mechanical engineer at Lenin's factory in Minsk. Later on, she transitioned to becoming a software engineer at Kirov's factory, where she worked with the programming language Cobol.<br><br>
                            
                            Tragedy struck when both our grandmother (in 1976) and grandfather (in 1977) passed away within a year of each other, when she was just 34-35 years old. Following these losses, she met our late father and started a family. I was born in 1978, and Danny followed in 1981.<br><br>
                            
                            As a mother, she provided us with a wonderful and joyous childhood. She imparted practical skills to us, such as riding bikes, swimming, cooking, and fixing things. We relished her cooking, eagerly awaiting the arrival of guests so she could prepare dishes we loved, like Gefilte fish, Borscht, holodez, potato with meat and mushrooms, eclairs, and many more.<br><br>
                            
                            She was a pragmatic and realistic person. In 1990, she made the life-changing decision to emigrate with us to Israel, leaving the USSR behind. This move was driven by her desire to provide us with a better life and future.
                            
                            In Israel, she worked at an Oranges factory for many years and supported our father during his illness. Together, they embarked on journeys to Turkey, Greece, France, Germany, and England.<br><br>
                            
                            In March 2018, she discovered she had cancer. Despite the challenges, she courageously battled the illness with various treatments and underwent five surgeries until July 2023.<br><br>

<p class="lead">If I had to describe my mom in one word, she was a warrior - a fearless woman who fearlessly confronted any challenge with a big heart and a vast soul. These qualities aren’t something taught in any school or university. <br><br>

    Her life journey commenced in January 1942, amidst the turmoil of World War II. Before her birth, the Nazis were deeply entrenched inside the USSR, and our late grandmother considered aborting her out of fear for her survival. However, despite several attempts, she survived, and grandma chose the name Isanna  to honor her father Israel.<br><br>
    
    
    Throughout her life, she excelled in all aspects. She was an exceptional student with beautiful penmanship, top-notch grades, and a warm heart. Despite the 5% restriction on Jews in higher education, she managed to pursue an engineering major at the university due to her outstanding grades.<br><br>
    
    
    Sadly, our grandmother and grandfather passed away within a year of each other while she was 34-35 years old. Subsequently, she met our late father and started a family. From the moment we were born, she enveloped us with love and warmth, taking care of our every need. She taught us practical skills like riding bikes, swimming, and fixing things, but more importantly, she instilled the value of respecting people, no matter where they came from. Her demeanor was gentle, never raising her voice or shouting, always giving her best to ensure our well-being.<br><br>
    
    
    Throughout her life, she had no enemies. Even in the face of illness, she remained humane, spreading love, respect, and care to everyone around her.<br><br>
    
    During her medical journey, she displayed remarkable strength and consideration for others. After surgery, her first concern was whether we had eaten. Even in her last days, she prioritized the well-being of her relatives and friends. The medical teams were captivated by her resilience, as she never complained or cried, always showing respect and a smile despite the intense pain.<br><br>
    
    In her final moments, she waited for me to finish breakfast before passing away. Her enduring lesson to us was to love and never give up, no matter the challenges we face, for it’s not the length of life that matters, but how we live it.<br><br>
    
    We hope that we, Danny, and the grandchildren brought her peace and happiness as bright spots in her life.<br><br>
    
    Mom, we will always cherish your memory, and may you rest in peace alongside dad. As we continue our journey, we know you’ll watch over us from above until we meet again. Your love will forever remain in our hearts, and we’ll remember you until our last breath.<br><br>

                     <p class="lead">Sofia Gavrilovna Zak was born in 1903 in Belarus, into a poor Jewish family. Due to financial constraints, she had to start working at an early age. She joined the Minsk Brewery as a worker and became involved in meetings of working youth, where she was inspired by the idea of creating a united youth organization to fight for workers’ interests.<br><br>

                        In December 1918, during a meeting at a youth club, she became one of the first members of the Komsomol (Communist Youth League). Later, during the Belopolskaya occupation, she actively participated in underground activities alongside fellow Komsomol members. Unfortunately, she was arrested by Polish counterintelligence and spent several months in prison in Vilna until she was exchanged for other underground workers.<br><br>
                        
                        After Belarus was liberated, Sofia G. Zak was sent by the Central Bureau of the Communist Bolshevik Party to study at the Sverdlov University in Moscow from 1921 to 1924. Upon graduation, she and her husband, who was also a university graduate, were assigned to party work. Sofia wanted to pursue higher education and attended the chemical faculty of a technical university in Samara, but her studies were cut short when her husband was transferred to a new location.<br><br>
                        
                        She became a mother to a son in 1924 and a daughter in 1926. However, in 1937, she faced repression. Prior to her arrest, she worked as the head of the Cult Propaganda Department at the Michurinsky city committee of the CPSU (b). Sofia G. Zak, a member of the CPSU (b) since 1919, was expelled in 1937 and subsequently arrested on October 15, 1937.<br><br>
                        
                        She was sentenced to ten years in labor camps and five years of disqualification, with her property confiscated. During her sentence in Norilsk, she worked in a mine at the Norilsk Mining and Metallurgical Combine. In 1942, she was involved in organizing a bacteriological laboratory, where she and other imprisoned specialists created bacteriophages that saved the lives of thousands of prisoners and civilian workers at the plant, fighting against serious diseases such as dysentery, tuberculosis, and syphilis.<br><br>
                        
                        On February 22, 1947, she was released after serving her sentence and having it reduced by 8 months. Sofia continued to work as the head of the bacteriological department at the sanitary and epidemiological station. In September 1952, she was transferred to a children’s place of residence in Kazakhstan by the special commandant’s office.<br><br>
                        
                        Finally, on October 5, 1955, she was half-rehabilitated by the decision of the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR. She later lived with her daughter in the Moscow region and her son in Minsk until her passing in 1981.<br><br>

                        A famouse Belarusian writer Piatrus Broyka included Sonia in his poem called "This is how youth began"

                            ТАК ПАЧЫНАЛАСЯ МАЛАДОСЦЬ<br>
                            (паэма)<br><br>

                            Над краінай заняўся пажар.<br>
                            Акупанты прышлі, што звяры,<br>
                            І краіна закутая стогне ад болю.<br>
                            Ходзіць Менскам жандар.<br>
                            І бунтоўна гарыць<br>
                            Комсомольскае сэрца ў глыбокім падполлі.<br><br>
                            
                            Не спазнаеш, хто свой, хто чужы?<br>
                            На рагу вартавы, быццам корч,<br>
                            Да асфальта прырос нерухомаю глыбай.<br>
                            Менск прыціх. Менск дрыжыць...<br>
                            Толькі вуліцай злосная ноч<br>
                            Б’е вар’яцкім крылом анямелыя шыбы.<br><br>
                            
                            На рагу вартавы, быццам корч.<br>
                            Дэфензіва. Нязмоўчна гудуць гаражы,<br>
                            Заліваюцца шпоры канаркаў ўсю ноч.<br>
                            Менск прыціх. Менск дрыжыць...<br><br>

                            Хоць жывому кідайся ў вяроўку —<br>
                            Сёння вечарам бачыў: зноў трое ішлі<br>
                            Між багнэтаў спакойна на Камароўку.<br>
                            І ў вачах іхні воблік праходзіць цяпер,<br>
                            Сэрца б’ецца ў агні, і балючым і палкім:<br>
                            Яны йдуць, як героі, спакойна на смерць,<br>
                            Быццам толькі ідуць на партыйную яўку. <br><br>
                            
                            Яны побліз ідуць. Не адходзяць ад воч.<br>
                            Яны кажуць: “Бывай-жа, таварыш!”<br>
                            Як-жа спаць Зайдэнвару ў гэткую ноч,<br>
                            Як-жа спаць Зайдэнвару?<br><br>
                            
                            І пакойчык яго абціскае адно:<br>
                            Сцены душаць бакі без ніякай патолі.<br>
                            Сторчма рушыцца столь. Сэрца б’ецца ў акно,<br>
                            Яно просіцца выйсці на волю.<br><br>
                            
                            Захістаўся пакой. І такая грызня —<br>
                            Ад газоўкі нясцерпны кідаецца жар.<br>
                            Цісне. Душыць кругом. І рукі не узняць.<br>
                            Што-ж ты робіш цяпер, Зайдэнвар? —<br><br>
                            
                            Крыкнуў так. А потым збянтэжана змоўк.<br>
                            — Што ты робіш, вар’ят? Свае зубы вазьмі на<br>
                            замок... —<br>
                            Зашаптаў ён сабе і пачуў: за сцяною гамонка,<br>
                            Шуміць самавар. Стала ясна кругом.<br>
                            Прасвятлела ў ваччу.<br>
                            Я... які-ж я цяпер Зайдэнвар?<br><br>
                            
                            І успомніўся дзень. І падпольны партком.<br>
                            І не стала трывог і ніякага жару.<br>
                            Пашпарт выдалі там. Абвялі алуўком:<br>
                            — “Ты ўжо Цукер, таварыш...”<br><br>
                            
                            За сцяною-ж гамонка ўжо ледзьве чуваць<br>
                            Пра адвечную тэму: аб грашох і аб хлебе.<br>
                            Стала смешна самому, хоць ідзі жартаваць:<br>
                            “Можа цукер патрэбен?..” <br><br>
                            
                            Цукер... Цукер салодкая рэч, ды не ўсім,<br>
                            Прад вачыма паўсталі канаркі крылатыя,<br>
                            Замільгалі пагоны у злой мітусні...<br>
                            — Вам я куляю буду, праклятыя!<br><br>
                            
                            Вам я куляю буду за пакуту і смерць,<br>
                            Што на вісельнях граеце першую скрыпку...<br>
                            Ноч гула за акном, як раз’юшаны звер,<br>
                            То як злодзей хадзіла за сценкай на цыпках.<br><br>
                            
                            Нарастала рашучасць, выціскаючы жах,<br>
                            Думкі рушылі сцены неўтаймованым гурмам...<br>
                            Цукер слухаў, як сэрца гарэла ў грудзях,<br>
                            Як гарачая кроў узнімалася бурна.<br><br>
                            
                            I хацелася зараз-жа выйсці, і стаць,<br>
                            І падужацца сілай з дэфензіўшчыкам кожным.<br>
                            А на памяць ўсплыло — загадаў сакратар:<br>
                            “Цукер, будзь асцярожным...<br><br>
                            
                            У глыбокім падполлі не месца свавольцам!”<br>
                            І пячатка задумы лягла на абліччы.<br>
                            Заўтра сход... Комсомольцы...<br>
                            Саўчык... Соня... Прашчыцкі...<br><br>
                            
                            Трэба моладзь агнём барацьбы запаліць,<br>
                            Навучыць быць упартай і разам старожкай.<br>
                            Мірыяды малюнкаў па столі плылі,<br>
                            І ўсхвалёваны Цукер кідаўся на ложку.<br><br>
                            
                            Яны-ж лезлі бясконца, бунтоўныя мары,<br>
                            І сціскалася моцна да болю рука.<br>
                            Так праходзіла ноч Зайдэнвара —<br>
                            Маладога падпольшчыка-большэвіка. <br><br>
                            
                            ІІ. Сходка на рэчцы<br><br>
                            
                            Вецер дзьме шалёны<br>

                            Сцюжа чортам лезе<br>
                            Проста у душу.<br><br>

                            Сквер дрыжыць у дзікім гуле.<br>
                            Дрэвы ляскаюць сукамі.<br>
                            Вецер кружыць жоўтым лісцем.<br>
                            I трывожна так шапочуць<br>
                            Ўсе дарожкі пад нагамі.<br><br>
                            
                            Ноч праходзіцца па бруку.<br>
                            Разам свісне дзе канарык.<br>
                            Свіст закружыцца, растае...<br>
                            На спатканне вышаў Цукер,<br>
                            Але ў гэткую цямноту<br>
                            Анікога не спазнаеш.<br><br>
                            
                            А на скверы акупанты.<br>
                            Прастытуткі ходзяць гужам,<br>
                            Каля іх вядуць ігрышча.<br>
                            Б’юць дванаццаць ўжо куранты.<br>
                            І шукае пільна ў ценях<br>
                            Цукер дзеўчыны аблічча.<br><br>
                            
                            Дзе-ж магла яна падзецца?<br>
                            Цукер помніць, як заўчора<br>
                            Умаўляліся ўдвох самі.<br>
                            Што-ж няма яе на месцы?<br>
                            А на яўцы патаемнай<br>
                            Вараб’ёў сядзіць з блінамі.<br><br>
                            
                            Ёв глядзіць праз плямы вокан<br>
                            І нервуе, што няма іх.<br>
                            Гэта-ж позна на двары ўжо. Гэта-ж позна!<br>
                            Не чуваць ніякіх крокаў...<br>
                            А пад світкай дынамітам<br>
                            Узрываюцца адозвы.<br><br>
                            
                            Што-ж няма яе сягоння?<br>
                            Цукер ходзіць цёмным скверам.<br>
                            І расце трывог багата.<br>
                            Узнялася падазронасць:<br>
                            Можа Сонька з Розеншайнам,<br>
                            Можа Сонька правакатар?<br><br>
                            
                            Так гадае ён нясмела,<br>
                            Бо у гэтай завірусе<br>
                            Цяжка ўдумліва разважыць.<br>
                            — Цукер!.. — ззаду даляцела.<br>
                            Стала сорамна да болю,<br>
                            За дарэмную абразу.<br>
                            “Я спазнілася, выбачце!..”<br>
                            І яна падходзіць блізка,<br>
                            Па-сяброўску цісне рукі:<br>
                            “Затрымала мяне маці...”<br>
                            I яны ўжо крочаць з Цукрам<br>
                            Праз крывенькія завулкі.<br><br>
                            
                            Так!.. спазніцца ў нас нянова,<br>
                            На падпольшчыка дарозе <br>
                            Шмат заўсёды сцежак цяжкіх.<br>
                            Яны йдуць да Вараб’ёва.<br>
                            Сонька шопатам тлумачыць,<br>
                            Як хавалася ад Яшкі.<br><br>
                            
                            Што-ж магло такое стацца?<br>
                            І трывожная цямнота<br>
                            Напаўняла вокны страхам...<br>
                            Вараб’ёў нервуе ў хаце.<br>
                            І паўзуць хвіліны нудна,<br>
                            Як валы разбітым шляхам.<br><br>
                            
                            І калі клапот без меры<br>
                            Праляцела ў сэрцы Пеці<br>
                            За адозвы і газеты, —<br>
                            Соня Зак адкрыла дзверы<br>
                            І здалося — ўвесь пакойчык<br>
                            Загарэўся цёплым светам.<br><br>
                            
                            Яна шчыра цісне рукі,<br>
                            І на твар яе кладзецца<br>
                            Прывітальная усмешка.<br>
                            І ўжо шэпча Пецю Цукер<br>
                            Пра свае блуканні ў скверы,<br>
                            Пра прыгодлівыя сцежкі.<br><br>
                            
                            І хутчэй усе за справу.<br>
                            Будзе сёння урачыстасць,<br>
                            Будзе ночка комсомольскай,<br>
                            Забушуюць ўсе кварталы<br>
                            Бурнай сілаю лістовак<br>
                            Супроць здзекаў белапольскіх.<br><br>
                            
                            А пакуль парадкам стройным<br>
                            Раскладалі матар’ялы<br>
                            Па кварталах і заводах,<br>
                            І разбілі па раёнах<br>
                            Там людзей і ўсе адозвы<br>
                            Да бунтоўнага пахода.<br><br>
                            
                            * * *<br><br>
                            
                            Месяц першае чаканкі<br>
                            Свеціць каскаю бліскучай,<br>
                            Што пажарны.<br>
                            Месяц вышаў на гулянку,<br>
                            Закружыў між правадамі...<br>
                            Спіць казарма.<br><br>
                            
                            Там жаўнеры маладыя<br>
                            Сняць пра родную хаціну,<br>
                            Мчацца крозы.<br>
                            Толькі ходзяць вартавыя<br>
                            З карабінамі ліхімі<br>
                            Па марозе.<br><br>
                            
                            А ў казарме дум без меры<br>
                            Ходзіць моракам трывожным<br>
                            Да світання.<br>
                            І да шмат якіх жаўнераў<br>
                            Думы лезуць неадчэпна,<br>
                            Сэрца раняць.<br><br>
                            
                            Хто-ж душу людскую змерыць,<br>
                            Калі розум абкруцілі<br>
                            Павучыннем.<br>
                            І не спяць тыя жаўнеры<br>
                            Праз увесь расклад казённы.<br>
                            Ні хвіліны.<br><br>
                            
                            І асілкам усплывае<br>
                            Фронт чырвоны,<br>
                            Там рабочыя усталі<br>
                            І сяляне бараніцца.<br>
                            І ў грудзях пячэ дакорна,<br>
                            Узнімаюцца сумненні:<br>
                            З кім-жа біцца?<br><br>
                            
                            Афіцэры-ж ходзяць зверам,<br>
                            Паміраць на фронце гоняць<br>
                            За айчыну.<br>
                            І не могуць спаць жаўнеры<br>
                            Праз увесь расклад казённы,<br>
                            Ні хвіліны.<br><br>
                            
                            За сцяною-ж вецер вые,<br>
                            І на сэрцы так пякуча,<br>
                            Так нягожа.<br>
                            Толькі ходзяць вартавыя<br>
                            З карабінамі ліхімі<br>
                            Па марозе.<br><br>
                            
                            А за рогам вельмі проста<br>
                            Комсомольцы шпацыруюць <br>
                            Вартавога кожны поступ<br>
                            Яны чуюць.<br><br>
                            
                            I як толькі вартавыя<br>
                            За другой сцяной пачэзлі,<br>
                            Комсомольцы вельмі жыва<br>
                            Усе адозвы паразнеслі.<br><br>
                            
                            Хай лютуюць сабе шпегі,<br>
                            Гэта ноч не пройдзе дарма.<br>
                            І адозвы белым снегам<br>
                            Забялелі ля казармаў.<br><br>
                            
                            Іх на раніцу падымуць,<br>
                            Прачытаюць можа тройчы.<br>
                            Падыходзяць вартавыя...<br>
                            І няма ўжо комсомольцаў.<br><br>
                            
                            * * *<br><br>
                            
                            Яны вышлі па вуліцы гэтай,<br>
                            Калі ноч на Траецкай гары,<br>
                            Калі грукаюць стаўні ад ветру<br>
                            І — калекі — дрыжаць ліхтары.<br><br>
                            
                            Яны вышлі у поступе грозным<br>
                            Вось на гэты азлоблены шлях <br>
                            І павешаны бомбы-адозвы<br>
                            Пад кашулямі ў іх на грудзях.<br><br>
                            
                            Так ідуць яны пляцам ізноўку,<br>
                            І, калі не трывожыць ніхто <br>
                            Ў іх лятуць, як гранаты, лістоўкі<br>
                            Праз кішэні ірваных пальто.<br><br>
                            
                            Кружыць снег, кружыць снег пракламацый,<br>
                            Саўчык з Сонькай раскідалі іх...<br>
                            Толькі слуп нерухомы на пляцы<br>
                            На вятры, як скаваны, стаіць.<br><br>
                            
                            Саўчык з Сонькай ідуць ля слупа;<br>
                            Потым раптам уразіла іх:<br>
                            Слуп ажыў, захадзіў, засвістаў,<br>
                            І пад месяцам выбліснуў штых.<br><br>
                            
                            Значыць трапілі да пастарунка,<br>
                            Можна тут і бяды прычакаць.<br>
                            “Паліцэйскі” — пранеслася ў думках.<br>
                            Саўчык з Сонькай пакінулі пляц.<br><br>
                            
                            Але ў сэрцах іх радасць без меры,<br>
                            Што падпольны свой здзейснілі план.<br>
                            Заўтра выйдуць з казармаў жаўнеры,<br>
                            Шмат наедзе на рынак сялян.<br><br>
                            
                            ЦІмат хто з іх, над сваёю вінтоўкай <br>
                            Там падумаюць тысячы крат.<br>
                            Заўтра будуць чытаць іх лістоўкі<br>
                            І сяброў ў іх народзіцца шмат.<br><br>
                            
                            Між штыхоў ў небяспецы бясконцай<br>
                            Па пляцах, па трывожных рагох <br>
                            Ходзяць цэлую ноч комсомольцы,<br>
                            Сеюць дум сваіх буйны агонь.<br><br>
                            
                            І няхай ад штыха уцякалі,<br>
                            Каб ён працу сарваць іх не мог.<br>
                            Саўчык з Сонькай на новым квартале<br>
                            Шпацыруюць павольна удвох.<br><br>
                            
                            Быццам вышлі, каб ночкай асенняй<br>
                            Прагуляцца і глянуць на свет, <br>
                            І ляціць праз разрэз у кішэні<br>
                            Ужо апошні закрыты канверт.<br><br>

                            І ўзняліся мільёны трывог:<br>
                            — Хто там ззаду за імі ішоў?<br>
                            Закалолі іголкі ў грудзёх <br>
                            Няўжо?..<br><br>
                            
                            Лёд трывог хутка зноў растае.<br>
                            Абываталь прышоў, як услужлівы ліс,<br>
                            Ён спакойна канверт падае:<br>
                            — Вы, напэўна, згубілі свой ліст.<br><br>
                            
                            Саўчык ліст той узяў у прызнанні глыбокім,<br>
                            Саўчык цісне руку яму некалькі крат:<br>
                            — Вельмі дзякую вам. — А праз некалькі крокаў<br>
                            Зноў канверт паляцеў на халодны асфальт...<br><br>
                            
                            Праца скончана. Не дагледзела панская варта.<br>
                            Маладых комсомольцаў нічым не стрымаць.<br>
                            Саўчык з Сонькай ідуць адпачыць, каб назаўтра<br>
                            Зноў падпольнымі думамі жыць, бунтаваць.<br><br>

                            Калі біўся вечар сіні<br>
                            І па цэхах змоўклі пілы.<br>
                            На заводзе перапынак. <br>
                            І ў кутку за розным ломам<br>
                            Моладзь голавы схіліла.<br><br>

                            Выняў ім з-пад сотні латак:<br>

                            Так па цёмных заканурках<br>
                            Нарасталі грозна сілы<br>

                            Праз сцюжу і золь.<br>
                            Так мацнеў і гарэў<br>

                            І радасць пылае з узбуджаных воч,<br>
                            I Бампі хавае той ліст на грудзях,<br>

                            IX. Комсомолец з Бабруйска<br><br>
                            
                            Так дні ішлі за працай той,<br>
                            І ўпарта білася падполле.<br>
                            І вось аднойчы, ужо вясной,<br>
                            Прышоў з Бабруйска комсомолец.<br><br>
                            
                            Дарожным пылам ён аброс,<br>
                            Ён крыўду ў сэрцы затаіў.<br>
                            Ён вестку страшную прынёс<br>
                            Пра лёс таварышаў сваіх.<br><br>
                            
                            І тут ў кругу сяброў ажыў,<br>
                            Сябе адчуў ён тут лягчэй.<br>
                            Ён ўвесь дрыжэў. Ён гаварыў,<br>
                            І боль струілася з вачэй:<br><br>
                            
                            “Таварышы! З-пад цяжкіх мук<br>
                            Я перад вамі тут увесь.<br>
                            Я вырваўся з жандарскіх рук,<br>
                            Я проста з шыбеніцы злез.<br><br>
                            
                            Я пяць начэй пакуты знёс,<br>

                            Я пешкам йшоў сто дваццаць вёрст,<br>
                            Як звер, сланяўся па лясах.<br><br>
                            
                            Я падаў ў процьмы сотні раз,<br>
                            Я падымаўся і ізноў,<br>
                            Я не глядзеў, я йшоў да вас<br>
                            З астатняй просьбаю хлапцоў.<br><br>
                            
                            Іх вобраз у мяне не змерк,<br>
                            Іх вобраз будзе век гарэць.<br>

                            Ні кроплі на вачах расы...<br>
                            I жонка з дзіцем бяжыць ўслед<br>
                            І рве з адчаю валасы.<br><br>
                            
                            А твар у Піні малады,<br>
                            Н’ат не парушыла сляза,<br>
                            І калі смерць была над ім,<br>
                            Залоцін Піня так сказаў:<br><br>
                            
                            “Не плач!<br>
                            Няхай мяне на смерць вядуць,<br>
                            Мне будзе лёгка там стаяць.<br>
                            Не плач! І сына так гадуй,<br>
                            Каб вырас гэткім, як і я.<br><br>
                            
                            А сонца ўжо гарыць ясней,v
                            Яму шчасліва будзе жыць!<br>
                            А вы ці чуеце мяне,<br>
                            Мае сябры-таварышы?!<br><br>

                            Але прабіў апошні час<br>
                            І смерць ляцела шпарка,<br>
                            І змоўк Залоцін Піня наш<br>
                            Пад кулямі канаркаў.<br><br>

                            Гершон туляўся па начах,<br>
                            Пакуль за фронт не ўцёк.<br><br>

                            Ён ўвесь дрыжэў. Ён гаварыў,<br>
                            І боль струілася з вачэй.<br><br>

                            І гарматы шалёна ізноў грукаталі...<br>
                            Свет дрыжэў, разарваны дратамі наскрозь,<br>

                            Дынамітнай трасучкай дрыжэла яна,<br>
                            Быццам свет захацела на часткі растрэсці...<br>
                            А да Менска прынесла з-пад фронта вясна<br>

                            Перад смерцю у вас між варожых штыхоў<br>
                            Бунтавалі юнацкія вочы;<br>
                            Як сапраўдныя дзеці большэвікоў,<br>
                            Вы прайшлі, комсомольцы!<br><br>
                            
                            Перад горам не паў на калені ніхто,<br>
                            Не дрыжэў нікалі перад ноччу:<br>
                            Праз агні барыкад, праз навалу франтоў<br>
                            Вы прайшлі, комсомольцы!<br><br>
                            
                            Вы магутнаю сілай стаялі ў баях.<br>
                            Ўзнагароджаны двойчы!<br>
                            На вялікай будоўлі, на звонкіх палях<br>
                            Хай жывуць комсомольцы!<br><br>
