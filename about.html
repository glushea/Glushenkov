        <p class="lead">I was born in Minsk in Belarus. Minsk is the capital and largest city of Belarus, and it is known for its rich cultural and historical heritage. One interesting aspect of Minsk's history is that it was completely destroyed during World War II and had to be completely rebuilt. As a result, much of the city's architecture is relatively modern, with many buildings dating from the post-war period. Despite this, Minsk has a number of historical landmarks and cultural attractions, including the National Art Museum, the Belarusian State Museum of the Great Patriotic War, and the Minsk City Hall. Minsk is also home to a number of beautiful parks and green spaces, making it an attractive and livable city for residents and visitors alike.</p>
<br>
            <p class="lead">Me and my parents emigrated to Israel once I was 12 years old. We were living in a town called Lod.  One fun fact about Lod, Israel that is related to St. George is that the city is home to the Church of St. George, which is a beautiful Crusader-era church that is still in use today. St. George (also known as a dragon slayer)  is the patron saint of England ,Ukraine Ethiopia, Georgia, Catalonia and Aragon in Spain, and Moscow in Russia and is known for his bravery and chivalry. According to legend, he was a soldier who fought against the Roman Empire and was martyred for his Christian faith. The Church of St. George in Lod is dedicated to him, and it is a popular site for tourists and pilgrims who are interested in the history and culture of the region.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="lead">I am happily married and currently reside with my wife and two children in the town of Givat Shmuel in Israel. One of my passions is travel, and I also have a love for delicious and healthy cuisine. I enjoy trying new foods from various cultures and have had the privilege of dining at some truly amazing restaurants, with L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon Etoile in Paris, France being a standout favorite. Argentina is also a country that holds a special place in my heart, as it is one of the best places I have had the opportunity to visit. In my leisure time, I enjoy indulging in a good book, watching TV series and movies, and attending stand-up comedy shows</p>

           <p class="lead">Having a sense of purpose and motivation is essential for both personal and professional fulfillment. Throughout my career, there have been a few common factors that have consistently motivated me: </p>
            <br>
           <ul class="about">
            <li>
                <span id="boldSpan">The crew: </span>To me, the people I work with are the most important factor in any career choice. Even the most successful leader is doomed to fail if they are surrounded by individuals they cannot effectively work with. For this reason, I carefully consider the individuals I will be working with whenever faced with a career decision. I seek out colleagues who are passionate about their work, prioritize the team over themselves, and take pride in their accomplishments. I believe in building relationships that go beyond the workplace and have maintained close friendships with colleagues from past jobs.
            </li>
            <li>
               <span id="boldSpan">Change making: </span> For me, it is essential that any work I do has a meaningful impact on society and the organization I am a part of. I believe it is important to contribute to something larger than oneself and make a positive difference in the world. That's why I have always sought out opportunities that allow me to make an impact and make a difference in the world and move the needle.

            </li>
            <li>
                <span id="boldSpan">The brain feast: </span>Throughout my career, I have always approached my professional development as a mosaic, rather than focusing on building expertise in a single domain. I have found that my love for learning new domains and technologies has served me well and has opened up a wide range of opportunities. I am excited to continue exploring new areas of interest and expanding my knowledge and skill set, and I can't wait to dive deeper into this domain

             </li>
           </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

      <div class="col-lg">
        <h1 class="display-5 fw-bold text-body-emphasis lh-1 mb-3">My Leadership finesse </h1>
           <p class="lead">As a leader, I am guided by a set of core principles that shape my approach to management and decision-making. These principles include:</p>
            <br>
           <ul class="about">
            <li>
                <span id="boldSpan">Empathetic and Caring: </span>As I mentioned before, I believe that people are the most important aspect of any organization. In the long run, what we accomplish as a team will be forgotten, but how we treat each other will always be remembered. In my previous roles, I have had the opportunity to build teams from the ground up and develop strong, personal connections with each team member. I understand their unique strengths, weaknesses, career goals, and personal circumstances, and I strive to support and empower them in every way possible. I would love to do the same here, getting to know each and every one of you more intimately and helping to drive the success of the business through our collective efforts and support for one another
            </li>
            <li>
                <span id="boldSpan">Trusting: </span>As a manager, I believe it is essential to surround myself with individuals who are more knowledgeable and skilled than I am. This allows me to be the least knowledgeable person on the team, and I take pride in that. I have full confidence in your expertise within your pillar/product area, and encourage my team to seek advice and not wait for permission to take action. While I trust that you will always get the job done, there may be certain programs that require more attention from me due to dependencies on other teams, impact on key metrics, or critical operational issues. In those cases, I may check in more frequently to ensure we are staying on track. Overall, my goal is to empower my team to take ownership and make decisions, while also being available to provide support and guidance when needed

            </li>
            <li>
                <span id="boldSpan">Transparent: </span>As a transparent and outspoken individual, I prioritize sharing information with my team as soon as it becomes available in order to ensure that we are all on the same page. This is particularly important in our organization given the cross-functional and cross-geographic collaborations that we often engage in. I welcome open and direct feedback and hope that you will also be open to receiving it. While I may occasionally advocate strongly for my own point of view, I am always willing to change my perspective if presented with strong data and counterarguments. I believe that open communication and a willingness to consider different perspectives is key to making informed and effective decisions. I strive to be transparent in my decision-making and to keep my team informed about the direction and goals of our organization.

             </li>
             <li>
                <span id="boldSpan">Adaptability: </span>I believe that the ability to adapt and respond to change is essential to success in today's rapidly-evolving business landscape. I am flexible and open to new ideas, and I encourage my team to embrace change and take calculated risks in pursuit of our goals.

             </li>
             <li>
                <span id="boldSpan">Systematic: </span>I find that having a clear and systematic approach to our work is essential to the success of our team. Whether we are building scalable products, managing complex programs, or simply operating as a cohesive unit, I believe that having a good rhythm of business is critical. Not only does this approach help to create predictability and inspire confidence, it also allows us to set clear expectations with our partners. I am particularly skilled at identifying and implementing processes and systems that enable us to work efficiently and effectively as a team. By creating a strong foundation of systematic and predictable practices, we are better able to focus on delivering high-quality results and meeting the needs of our partners

             </li>
             <li>
                <span id="boldSpan">Collaborative: </span>As a decision-maker, I am committed to involving others in the process and ensuring that all voices are heard. I believe that making informed and well-rounded decisions requires considering a diverse range of perspectives, and I strive to involve others in the process whenever possible. Whether I am leading a team or working as part of one, I make a point of seeking input and feedback from my colleagues, and I value the insights and ideas that they bring to the table. By involving others in the decision-making process, we are able to make more informed and effective choices, and I believe that this approach leads to stronger outcomes and greater buy-in from all involved.

I hold myself and my team to high standards and expect us to lead by example, taking accountability for the problems we are best equipped to solve. In addition to focusing on our individual functions, I encourage us to think more broadly about the overall business, organization, and company when making decisions.Ultimately, my goal is to contribute to the success of our team and organization in a meaningful and impactful way</p>

            <li draggable="true">One of my greatest strengths is my ability to quickly gain context and effectively operate in a variety of domains.</li>

            <li draggable="true">I am known for my diligence and thoroughness, sometimes to the point of being obsessive about having a solid plan for everything.</li>
             <li draggable="true">I have a great sense of humor and enjoy making people laugh.</li>
